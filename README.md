c# classes that download data direct from Wikidata and Wikipedia

I wrote these classes specifically for my biographical validation work (see WikidataBioValidate)  Consequently, the only bits that I know work are the items I specifically required for my own esoteric project. For example. they totally ignore references. There are likely some datatypes that are not handled. The URL parameters ae hardcoded to produce what I liked!

Nevertheless, they work for me and provide a foundation for future work.


Latest news:
A career change means that I (MortimerCat) will no longer be using C# as a programming language. This branch will now remain untouched. I will leave it online as an example of how to grab wikidata, but as I touched on above, I had barely started in creating an all purpose interface to Wikidata.
